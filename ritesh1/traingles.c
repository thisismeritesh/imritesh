/**You are given  triangles, specifically, their sides ,  and . Print them in the same style but sorted by their areas from the smallest one to the largest one. It is guaranteed that all the areas are different.

The best way to calculate a area of a triangle with sides ,  and  is Heron's formula:

 where .
